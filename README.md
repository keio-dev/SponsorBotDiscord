WHAT IS A SPONSOR BOT?

A sponsor bot is basically a bot that you can use for server advertisation like many server have. You can either make one yourself or ask someone to make you one. This projet will take (and took me) a long time to make (started doing bots not too long ago). If you find any errors, you can join me by Discord, that's the fastest way I can respond even tho im busy sometimes.

WHY DID I MAKE THIS?

I made a sponsor bot just to test my informatic skills to see if I can actually make one. If I somehow let down the projet (reason below), do not ask me on Discord "Why is your projet not finished" or whatever. I'll simply add some information and delete all of the codes for the bot

WHY WOULD I LET DOWN THE PROJET?

Probably school or just lack of ideas and just being lazy as shit.
